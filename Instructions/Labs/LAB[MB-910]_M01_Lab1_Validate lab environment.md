Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Dynamics 365 Marketing
========================

Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365
------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Log into the Dynamics 365

1.  Access <https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/> and log in with your user credentials.

2. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization. 

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

3. Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but **do not make any changes**.

### Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1.  Expand the App Launcher domino button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of **Power Platform admin center. Select the Dynamics 365 **Marketing** app to launch it.

2.  Explore the navigation pane on the left hand side. The button on the bottom of the pane allows you to change areas. You are currently viewing the **Marketing** area. 

3.  Select **Marketing** at the botton of the navigation pane and select the **Events** area. Explore the **Events** area of the navigation pane.  

4. Spend a few minutes exploring the application and then return to the **Marketing** area.
