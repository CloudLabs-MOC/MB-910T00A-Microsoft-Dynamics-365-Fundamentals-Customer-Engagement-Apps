7. On the lower left side of the screen, at the very bottom of the left-hand navigation pane or **Site Map**, select the text **Sales**, from the list that appears, select **App Settings.** **App Settings** is where you can review and make changes to administrative settings. Notice how the left-hand navigation items have changed.

8. Select the **Change Area** selector again and change it from **App Settings** back to **Sales**.

9. If you want to switch from the Sales app to a different app such as Customer Service workspace, select the **Sales Hub** text in the upper left part of the screen next to the text Dynamic 365.

10.  The **Apps** selector pop-up will appear, select **Customer Service Hub** and you will be taken to the **Customer Service Hub** application. Notice the **Customer Service Hub** has different areas available in the **Change Area** menu.
