Module 1: Describe the foundations of Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps
========================

## Practice Lab 1.1 - Work with customer engagement apps 

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will become familiar with how to access the different Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications by leveraging the Microsoft Office 365 apps screen. 

## Lab Setup

  - **Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## Instructions

1.  In a web browser, open a new tab and navigate to `https://www.office.com/apps` and sign in. All the Microsoft applications that you have access to will be displayed. 

2.  Under **Get work done**, select the **Business Apps** tab to filter just Dynamics 365 business applications. 

3.  Select the **Search** field located at the top screen. 

4.  Enter the text `Sales Hub` and select the **Sales Hub** app to open it. 

5.  When you are in an app, there are different areas that you can work with based on what you are trying to do. For example, the **Sales Hub** application is built with five different areas that you can work with. 

6.  On the lower left side of the screen, at the very bottom of the left-hand navigation pane or **Site Map**, select the **Sales** menu. From the list that appears, select **App Settings**. This area of the application is where you can review and make changes to administrative settings. 

7.  Select the **Change Area** selector again and change it from **App Settings** back to **Sales**. 

8.  If you want to switch from the **Sales Hub** app to a different app such as the **Customer Service Hub**, select the **Sales Hub** text in the upper left part of the screen, next to the title text **Dynamics 365**. 

9.  The **Apps** pop-up will appear, select **Customer Service Hub** and you will be taken to the **Customer Service Hub** application. Notice the **Customer Service Hub** has different areas available in the **Change Area** menu. 

10. To switch back to the **Sales Hub** app, select the **Customer Service Hub** text at the top which opens the **Apps** selector pop-up.
