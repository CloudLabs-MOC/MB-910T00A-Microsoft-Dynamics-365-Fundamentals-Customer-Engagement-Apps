# Demo: Creating Purchase Orders

## Instructions

Most work orders will contain some type of product on it. This might be products to be installed, or replacement parts. May times, the parts needed to execute a work order or booking will already be on hand in a warehouse. Other times they may need to be ordered. Dynamics 365 Field Service includes the ability requisition purchase orders for ordering product as well as the ability to initiate returns when a product what not used. 

 

Open Dynamics 365 Field Service 

 

Depending on your organizational needs the process for requesting product can vary. Some organizations do not want technicians creating purchase orders directly while others do. Regardless of the specific policies for an Organization, Dynamics 365 Field Service provides the ability to create Purchase orders directly in the application. Purchase Orders can be created by Technicians, Purchasers, or other employees. 

1. Switch the Area to Inventory and Click Purchase Orders.

	- Create a New Purchase Order

		- Call out information on the Details tab that are important such as Warehouse information, Payment details, work order and booking information, vendor etc. 

		- Be sure to mention and show the Purchase order process that is highlighted at the top of the application. 

		- Define the Product or Products that are being ordered as part of the purchase order. 

		- Talk through what the approval process might look like.

2. Receive Po Products

	- Sometimes all the product being requested will come in at one time, other times depending on factors such as back order status, quantities, etc, only partial quantities of product will arrive. Dynamics 365 lets you receive the product as it comes in and document the specific quantities you received vs the quantities ordered. 

		- Open an existing Product

		- Go to Product Receipts and create a Product Receipt

		- On the Product Receipt, receive Product Quantities. 

			1. Show receiving both complete quantities and partial quantities. 

- Walk through creating multiple receipts as different quantities of product come in. 

- Once the all items have been received, walk through getting the Purchase Order Ready for Billing.
